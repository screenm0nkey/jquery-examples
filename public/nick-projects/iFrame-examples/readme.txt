bookmarklet-for-iframes is a bookmarklet and iframe resizer. I loads some javascript and loads the iframes

iframes-and-ajax-load uses the bookmarklet above to load iframe but the main part is the main.js. The examples above
only uses iFrame but this example uses ajax to load the content into a div, which still sits in an iframe.
