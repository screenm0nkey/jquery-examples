  <title>Welcome</title>

  <para>jQuery is fast becoming a must-have skill for front-end developers.
  The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of the jQuery JavaScript
  library; when you're done with the book, you should be able to complete
  basic tasks using jQuery, and have a solid basis from which to continue your
  learning. This book was designed as material to be used in a classroom
  setting, but you may find it useful for individual study.</para>

  <para>This is a hands-on class. We will spend a bit of time covering a
  concept, and then you’ll have the chance to work on an exercise related to
  the concept. Some of the exercises may seem trivial; others may be downright
  daunting. In either case, there is no grade; the goal is simply to get you
  comfortable working your way through problems you’ll commonly be called upon
  to solve using jQuery. Example solutions to all of the exercises are
  included in the sample code.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Getting the Code</title>

    <para>The code we’ll be using in this book is hosted <link
    xlink:href="http://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals">in a repository on
    Github</link>. You can download a .zip or .tar file of the code, then
    uncompress it to use it on your server. If you’re git-inclined, you’re
    welcome to clone or fork the repository.</para>
  </section>

    <title>Software</title>

    <para>You'll want to have the following tools to make the most of the
    class:</para>

  <section>
    <title>Adding JavaScript to Your Page</title>

    <para>JavaScript can be included inline or by including an external file
    via a script tag. The order in which you include JavaScript is important:
    dependencies must be included before the script that depends on
    them.</para>

    <para>For the sake of page performance, JavaScript should be included as
    close to the end of your HTML as is practical. Multiple JavaScript files
    should be combined for production use.</para>

    <example>
      <title>An example of inline Javascript</title>

      <programlisting>&lt;script&gt;
console.log('hello');
&lt;/script&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>An example of including external JavaScript</title>

      <programlisting>&lt;script src='/js/jquery.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</programlisting>
    </example>

  <section>
    <title>JavaScript Debugging</title>

    <para>A debugging tool is essential for JavaScript development. Firefox
    provides a debugger via the Firebug extension; Safari and Chrome provide
    built-in consoles.</para>

    <para>Each console offers:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>single- and multi-line editors for experimenting with
        JavaScript</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>an inspector for looking at the generated source of your
        page</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>a Network or Resources view, to examine network requests</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When you are writing JavaScript code, you can use the following
    methods to send messages to the console:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><code>console.log()</code> for sending general log
        messages</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code>console.dir()</code> for logging a browseable
        object</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code>console.warn()</code> for logging warnings</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><code>console.error()</code> for logging error messages</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Other console methods are also available, though they may differ
    from one browser to another. The consoles also provide the ability to set
    break points and watch expressions in your code for debugging
    purposes.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Exercises</title>

    <para>Most chapters in the book conclude with one or more exercises. For
    some exercises, you’ll be able to work directly in Firebug; for others,
    you will need to include other scripts after the jQuery script tag as
    directed in the individual exercises.</para>

    <para>In some cases, you will need to consult the jQuery documentation in
    order to complete an exercise, as we won’t have covered all of the
    relevant information in the book. This is by design; the jQuery library is
    large, and learning to find answers in the documentation is an important
    part of the process.</para>

    <para>Here are a few suggestions for tackling these problems:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First, make sure you thoroughly understand the problem you're
        being asked to solve.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Next, figure out which elements you'll need to access in order
        to solve the problem, and determine how you'll get those elements. Use
        Firebug to verify that you're getting the elements you're
        after.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Finally, figure out what you need to do with the elements to
        solve the problem. It can be helpful to write comments explaining what
        you're going to do before you try to write the code to do it.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Do not be afraid to make mistakes! Do not try to make your code
    perfect on the first try! Making mistakes and experimenting with solutions
    is part of learning the library, and you’ll be a better developer for it.
    Examples of solutions for these exercises are located in the
    <filename>/solutions</filename> directory in the sample code.</para>

    <title>Conventions used in this book</title>

    <para>Methods that can be called on jQuery objects will be referred to as
    <code>$.fn.methodName</code>. Methods that exist in the jQuery namespace
    but that cannot be called on jQuery objects will be referred to as
    <code>$.methodName</code>. If this doesn't mean much to you, don't worry —
    it should become clearer as you progress through the book.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Example of an example</title>

      <programlisting>// code examples will appear like this</programlisting>
    </example>

    <remark>Remarks will appear like this.</remark>

    <note>
      <para>Notes about a topic will appear like this.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Reference Material</title>

    <para>There are any number of articles and blog posts out there that
    address some aspect of jQuery. Some are phenomenal; some are downright
    wrong. When you read an article about jQuery, be sure it's talking about
    the same version as you're using, and resist the urge to just copy and
    paste — take the time to understand the code in the article. </para>

    <para>Here are some excellent resources to use during your jQuery
    learning. The most important of all is the jQuery source itself: it
    contains, in code form, complete documentation of the library. It is not a
    black box — your understanding of the library will grow exponentially if
    you spend some time visiting it now and again — and I highly recommend
    bookmarking it in your browser and referring to it often.</para>
